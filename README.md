## Featured Project

### Logistics Operations Analytics — Driver Performance & Fleet Efficiency
![Fleet Overview](images/fleet_overview.png)

**Business Problem**  
Operations teams often assume that individual driver performance materially affects revenue and efficiency. This project evaluates whether driver-level KPIs meaningfully explain revenue outcomes or whether performance is driven by system-level factors.

**Key Findings**  
- Driver-level performance metrics showed minimal variation across individuals  
- Individual driver KPIs exhibited limited explanatory power with respect to revenue  
- Results indicate that system-level operational factors are likely the primary drivers of revenue and efficiency  

**Business Implications**  
- Individual driver performance is unlikely to be a high-impact management lever  
- Analytical and operational focus should be directed toward routing, demand patterns, load characteristics, or pricing rather than driver-level interventions  

**Analytical Approach & Deliverables**  
- Designed a relational data model and created SQL views consumed by Power BI to ensure consistent KPI reporting, with CTEs used for exploratory and ad-hoc analysis
- Analyzed driver and fleet-level performance trends using SQL  
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to support fleet-level monitoring and decision-making
